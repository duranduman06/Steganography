Image Steganography with LSB (Least Significant Bits)

The Least Significant Bit (LSB) is the rightmost bit in a binary representation of a number. In the context of image steganography, each pixel in a digital image is represented by a combination of bits, typically in the Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) color model. Each color channel (R, G, or B) of a pixel is represented by 8 bits, ranging from 0 to 255. 
The LSB of each color channel is the least significant bit of the 8 bits. This means it holds the smallest numerical value and has the least impact on the color representation. The key idea behind LSB steganography is to modify these least significant bits to embed hidden information without significantly altering the visual appearance of the image.
